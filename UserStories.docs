Some Edge cases in the project :
1. LocalStorage Limitations or Failure
-Browser blocks or fails to access localStorage.
-Streak tracking should fail gracefully without affecting core functionality.

2. External API Fails to Respond (Tier 2 and beyond)
-App fails to fetch quiz data due to network error or server issue.
-Display a friendly error message and fallback behavior (e.g., retry or offline mode).

3. Layout Issues on Small Screens
-UI components may break or overflow on mobile devices.
-4Responsive design should ensure all quiz elements are usable and accessible.

4. Perfect or Zero Score
-User scores either 0/5 or 5/5.
-ResultCard should display these scores correctly without layout or logic issues.
